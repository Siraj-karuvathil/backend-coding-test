This is a Node.js application that uses the Express.js framework to define and handle HTTP routes for a ride-hailing service.
The code exports an Express application that takes a database connection object as an argument and defines the following routes:

GET /health: Returns a "Healthy" message to confirm that the server is up and running.

POST /rides: Accepts a JSON payload containing information about a ride, validates the payload, and inserts the ride data into the database.
    If there are any validation errors or database errors, an error response is returned with a relevant error code and message.
    If the ride is successfully inserted, the response includes the inserted ride data.

GET /rides: Retrieves all rides from the database and returns them as a JSON array. If there are no rides, an error response is returned with an error code and message.

GET /rides/:id: Retrieves a ride with the specified ride ID from the database and returns it as a JSON object.
    If the ride is not found, an error response is returned with an error code and message.

The validation checks ensure that the latitude and longitude values are within the range of -90 to 90 and -180 to 180 degrees, respectively, and that the rider name, driver name, and driver vehicle are non-empty strings.

The code uses the body-parser middleware to parse the JSON payload in the POST request and SQLite3 library to execute SQL queries on the database.
